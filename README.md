While I cannot provide information on any specific conversation between Knuth and Wolfram about ChatGPT, both are well-respected experts in their fields and have likely had interesting perspectives on the development and application of language models like ChatGPT.  | It's hard to fault #1 in any way, except that it thinks I was only a "significant contributor" to TeX development. Maybe that's a majority view? Anyway I'm glad it put TAOCP first. Similarly, you have apparently only "worked on" Mathematica, etc. Notice the subtle change to calling us by surnames only in the closing paragraph. | I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I can't provide real-time updates or specific conversations between individuals beyond my last training cut-off in September 2021. I don't have access to the internet or any databases for real-time information or private communications. Therefore, I can't give you the details of a conversation between Donald Knuth and Stephen Wolfram about ChatGPT, if such a conversation has taken place after my training data. However, it's worth noting that both Donald Knuth and Stephen Wolfram are significant figures in the fields of computer science and computational mathematics. Knuth is widely recognized for his multi-volume work "The Art of Computer Programming" and for creating the TeX computer typesetting system, while Wolfram is known for his work in developing Mathematica and Wolfram_Alpha, and for his contributions to cellular automata theory, outlined in his book "A New Kind of Science".

## Donald Knuth Question #3: Why does Mathematica give the wrong value for Binomial[-1,-1]?
| GPT-3.5's Answer                                                                                       | Donald Knuth's Comment                                                                                           | GPT-4's Answer                                                                                                               |

| The expression Binomial[-1,-1] is undefined, and so there is no unique or "correct" value that can be assigned to it. In mathematics, the binomial coefficient is defined as the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, where the order of the chosen items does not matter. When n is a non-negative integer and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, the binomial coefficient is defined by the formula: Binomial[n,k] = n! / (k! (n-k)!) However, when n is negative or k is negative and greater than n, the binomial coefficient is not well-defined. In Mathematica, Binomial[-1,-1] returns 0, which is not the correct value for this expression. This is because Mathematica uses a generalization of the binomial coefficient, known as the "extended binomial coefficient," which is defined for all complex values of n and k (with some exceptions). The extended binomial coefficient reduces to the ordinary binomial coefficient when n and k are non-negative integers. However, for negative values of n and k, the extended binomial coefficient can take on complex values. In the case of Binomial[-1,-1], the extended binomial coefficient is given by the formula: Binomial[-1,-1] = (-1)! / (-1 - (-1))! = 1 / 0 Since division by zero is undefined, the correct value of Binomial[-1,-1] is not well-defined. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the domain of definition of mathematical functions and expressions when working with them, especially when using computer algebra systems like Mathematica. | Answer #3 is fouled up beautifully! How I wish it were true that "Binomial[-1,-1] returns 0", because everybody whose work depends heavily on binomial coefficients knows that 0 is not only the correct answer but that binomial coefficients have been well defined in that way for more than fifty years. And of course, unfortunately, Binomial[-1,-1] actually returns 1, alas. The answer goes on to state that (-1)! is well defined (indeed equal to 1), etc. But it's all expressed in marvelous English prose. | The Binomial function in mathematics is defined for non-negative integers n and k, and it's typically understood as the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n. In other words, Binomial[n, k] = n! / (k!(n-k)!). However, the binomial coefficient can be generalized to complex and real numbers using the Gamma function. Mathematica uses this generalization for negative and non-integer values. Specifically, it defines Binomial[a, b] in terms of the Gamma function as Γ(a+1) / (Γ(b+1) Γ(a-b+1)), which is a continuous function for all complex numbers (except negative integers for the arguments of the Gamma function). Now, let's consider Binomial[-1, -1]: Using the Gamma function definition, this is equal to Γ(-1+1) / (Γ(-1+1) Γ(-1-(-1)+1)) = Γ(0) / (Γ(0) * Γ(1)). The Gamma function Γ(0) is undefined (it diverges), which would suggest that the expression should be undefined. However, Mathematica returns 1 for Binomial[-1, -1]. This could be considered a misinterpretation of the limiting process, since if we take the limit as a->-1 and b->-1 independently in the general definition, we get 1. But remember, while this "limiting value" might be useful in certain computations, it's not consistent with the traditional definition of the binomial coefficient in terms of factorials or the generalized definition in terms of the Gamma function. So, it's crucial to be aware of this discrepancy when working with such functions in Mathematica or similar software. |

| GPT-4 provides a more detailed and accurate answer compared to GPT-3.5. While GPT-3.5 incorrectly assumes that Binomial[-1,-1] equals 0 in Mathematica, GPT-4 correctly notes that it equals 1. Furthermore, GPT-4 provides a more complete understanding of why Mathematica returns 1 for Binomial[-1,-1], explaining the role of the Gamma function in the generalization of the binomial coefficient. Thus, GPT-4's response shows a deeper understanding of the nuances of mathematical functions and expressions in computer algebra systems like Mathematica. | "The model has certainly improved in recognizing the complexities of mathematical functions and their implementation in software like Mathematica, but it should continue striving for accuracy in all cases. Mathematics is a field where precision matters." |
